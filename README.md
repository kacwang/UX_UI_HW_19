UX/UI Bootcamp: Module 19

Things we learned about in Module 19 that I used:

- jQuery event listener for stick figure in the corner

Notes:
- The stick figure will be replaced with a still illustration that becomes a GIF when you mouse over the illustration. I will create the illustration and animate the GIF in After Effects later.
